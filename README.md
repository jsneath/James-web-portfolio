# James Web portfolio

## Introduction

This website was built as part of a challenge to show off my current web portfolio. I will be adding and improving this throughout the next 3/4 months as my skills improve.

I only have 1 website available as part of my portfolio so i've had to use github links to the remaining projects. 

## Features

Personal Introduction: Upon loading, the page displays my name, a recent photo, and links to various sections about me, my work, and contact information.

Navigation: Clicking on any navigation link scrolls you to the corresponding section, enhancing user experience.

Portfolio Showcase: The 'Work' section flaunts images of my projects. Although some might be placeholders for now, they will be replaced with real applications as I continue my journey.
